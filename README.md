# prizm-winsim

A full Windows simulator of the Prizm API and syscalls for improving development iteration times.

# Basic directions

Clone to your Prizm SDK projects directory in order to use the prizm-winsim library with other projects, such as Prizm. I will try to put together an empty project folder as a template soon that supports cross compilation between Prizm and Winsim.
