# prizm-winsim

A full Windows simulator of the Prizm API and syscalls for improving development iteration times.

# Basic directions

Clone to your Prizm SDK projects directory in order to use the prizm-winsim library with other projects, such as Prizm.

# Fork

This repository is a fork of [tswilliamson/prizm-winsim](https://github.com/tswilliamson/prizm-winsim).
Its purpose is to use with Flip's Little Adventure project. Syscalls and features are added as I needed. It is possible for some syscalls to not behave as it would on the calculator.
