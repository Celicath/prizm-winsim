# prizm-winsim

A full Windows simulator of the Prizm API and syscalls for improving development iteration times.

# Basic directions

Clone to your Prizm SDK projects directory in order to use the prizm-winsim library with other projects, such as Prizm.

# Fork

This repository is a fork of [tswilliamson/prizm-winsim](https://github.com/tswilliamson/prizm-winsim).
It's purpose is for Flipp's Castle Defense project. When I need, I'm adding some syscalls and features. Since the goal is not to make a perfect emulation of Prizm, some syscalls might not work properly depending on the parameters.
